User must accept this User Statement explicitly before downloading and/or using any software related to the use and functionality of the FALCON Chain. This relates in particular, but not exclusively, to the Falcon Desktop Wallet software (&ldquo;<strong>Falcon Desktop Wallet</strong>&rdquo;).</p><ol type="I"><li><h3><strong>General Remarks</strong></h3></li></ol><p><strong>SOFTWARE CONCEPT</strong>: The FALCON open source community (collectively encompassing all entities and individuals involved in the deployment, maintenance and development of the FALCON Chain and its applications &ldquo;<strong>Open Source Community</strong>&rdquo;) has developed a blockchain protocol, which enables confidential interactions between its users (&ldquo;<strong>User</strong>&rdquo;/&rdquo;<strong>Users</strong>&rdquo;) and the development and deployment of so called decentralized applications running on this protocol (&ldquo;<strong>FALCON Protocol</strong>&rdquo;, respectively &ldquo;<strong>FALCON Chain</strong>&rdquo;). The FALCON Chain software, any of its features (e.g. cold staking, privacy applications etc.) as well as the involved front- and back-end implementations related to the FALCON Chain or its use (&ldquo;<strong>FALCON Software</strong>&rdquo;) are developed and released under permissive open source licenses. WHILE THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY DEVELOPED THE FALCON SOFTWARE, IT IS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OF THE INTERACTIONS BY USERS AMONGST EACH OTHER OR WITH THE FALCON SOFTWARE.</p><ol start="2" type="I"><li><h3><strong>FALCON Chain Live Environment</strong></h3></li></ol><p><strong>DEPLOYMENT OF FALCON SOFTWARE:</strong> USER UNDERSTANDS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FALCON SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT, DESPITE BEING THOUROUGLY TESTED AND AUDITED, IS OF EXPERIMENTAL NATURE AND DEPLOYED ACCORDING TO THE BEST EFFORTS OF THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY. ANY FNC TOKEN (&ldquo;<strong>FNC</strong>&rdquo;) OR OTHER CRYPTO ASSETS USED TO INTERACT WITH THE FALCON SOFTWARE ARE AT RISK OF BEING LOST INDEFINITELY. In particular, User acknowledges that the FALCON Software, even though developed in accordance to the state of the art, is likely to contain bugs, defects, or errors (including any bug, defect, or error relating to or resulting from the display, manipulation, processing, storage, transmission, or use of data) that materially and adversely affects the use, functionality, or performance of the FALCON Chain or any application or system containing or used in conjunction with the FALCON Chain.</p><ol start="3" type="I"><li><h3><strong>Disclaimer of Warranty</strong></h3></li></ol><p><strong>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE FALCON SOFTWARE</strong>: To the extent permitted by applicable law, any and all warranty for the FALCON Software is excluded. The Open Source Community provides the FALCON Software &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In no event shall the Open Source Community be liable of any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption). The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the FALCON Software is with User.

When registering on the FALCON Chain, User will be responsible for keeping his private key information safe. The Open Source Community will at no time offer a traditional username/password login method to User and will at no time have access to User&rsquo;s private keys, seed phrase or passwords. Such information is therefore never sent to the servers of the Open Source Community or otherwise made known to the Open Source Community. The Open Source Community and its members cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from User&rsquo;s failure to comply with this section </p><ol start="6" type="I"><li><h3><strong>Assumption of Risks of Economic Losses / Careless and/or Malicious Participants</strong></h3></li></ol><p><strong>INTERACTIONS WITH THE FALCON CHAIN CANNOT BE REVISED</strong>: User understands that there are no rights of recourse or compensation against the Open Source Community, especially with regards to the loss or theft of FNC or other crypto assets, malfunctioning of the FALCON Chain, external abuse of the FALCON Chain, or misbehavior of other Users.</p><p><strong>THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY</strong><strong> IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION OF THE FALCON SOFTWARE AND ITS USE</strong>: User understands that THE Open Source Community does not have control over Users and their interactions within the FALCON Chain. The Open Source Community never holds custody of the tokens/assets held by the Users, nor does it have the ability to do so. All assets (if any) are controlled by the automated &ldquo;two-party escrow mechanism of the FALCON Chain&ldquo;. USER UNDERSTANDS THAT THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN USERS ON THE FALCON CHAIN HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OTHER THAN THE USERS INVOLVED. Users are neither controlled, managed or vetted by the Open Source Community, nor can they be.
